Here are the rules to push code and working on the code:

****Pulling code from the repository****

If you are to PULL code to modify, SEND A MESSAGE IN THE INSTAGRAM GROUP CHAT 
If you start working on the software while someone is also working, then one of you guys' work will go to waste. 
Don't risk that chance because it sucks.


****Pushing code from the repository****

If you are working on the code but need to go eat, or you're taking a break. PUSH THE CODE.
When you PUSH, Provide A short message explain what changes you did. That way we can look through the history of the code for debugged if there's an issue.
Once you PUSH, PLEASE SEND IN THE GROUPCHAT that code has been pushed So that people can have their turn to work.



**How to PUSH code **
1) git add .
2) git commit -m "Your commit message here"


WE got this ðŸ’ª
